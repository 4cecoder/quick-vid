This is a **help** dialogue for selected comments. You can do various things with a comment. And here is a place to find commands that you can use.

*To go back from comments, just press enter without typing anything.*

**help**

Gives you this help dialogue.

**read**

If the comment is long and/or in a markdown format, you may want to read it properly. This will put the comment's text into our markdown preview thing.

**channel**

Lists publications by the channel that wrote the current comment.

**comments**

If a comment has replies. It will list replies. I use **comments** and not **replies** to simplify the commands structure. Treating comments like tiny publications on the LBRY. And vise versa. 

**reply**

Reply to a comment.
