This is a help for all kinds of graphs of FastLBRY terminal.

**numbers**

Show stripped down, relevant data in a table, rather than a graph.

**save**

Save a graph raw data into a json. You can load it back from the main menu using **load_graph**.

**raw**

Will show raw data that the graph received. ( The format of the data may be different in different places. )

**csv**

Opens a *csv* formatted raw data in a default application. ( Note that it makes a temporary file, to save it securely use "Save As" in your default application. )

**zoom**

Opens a graph on only a part of the current data. Under the graph there is a ruler made for this purpose. You may input a number like: **zoom 15** to open only data in the 15th slot. Or you can use a range of slots like: **zoom 12 57** which will give you a graph on the data between the slots 12 and 57. Of course you can use whatever numbers you desire. As long as they are in the ruler's range. Note that the rules skips a few numbers for visibility. It doesn't mean that you can't use those skipped number. You can. They are skipped only for visibility.
