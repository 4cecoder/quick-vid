This file will explain how to create a channel on the LBRY network using FastLBRY. While doing so you need to fill up a form with variables. Some of them are optional. So you can skip this whole thing and move on with publishing. But you may want to put more information like a title and description.

For now, the only things that are required to create a channel, the name and the bid, have already been inputted. All the other variables are optional.

**help**

Show this help dialog.

**name**

Prompts for the name of the channel, like `@blenderdumbass`. Putting the '@' is optional, if you don't put it the program will do it for you.

**bid**

Prompts for the bid for the channel. If multiple channels have the same name, the channel with the largest bid will be the first result, so if you want to create a channel with a name that's been taken you should have a larger bid.

**title**

Prompts for the title for the channel.

**description**

Prompts for the description for the channel. You can also put a file or command for a text editor behind the command, so `description a.md` gets the description from the file `a.md` and `description vim` opens `vim` for you to type the description.

**email**

Prompts for the email of the channel owner.

**website**

Prompts for the website of the channel.

**thumbnail**

Prompts for the URL for the thumbnail of the channel.

**cover**

Prompts for the URL for the cover image of the channel.

**tags**

Prompts for the tags for the channel, separated by commas.

**languages**

Prompts for the language(s) of the channel, separated by commas if there are multiple.

**create**

Creates the channel with the current settings.
